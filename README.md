# Power BI Dashboard for Call Center Performance Analysis

This repository showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for a call center operation. Built during my virtual data analyst internship at PwC, this project helped PhoneNow's call center manager gain valuable insights into customer and agent behavior, driving actionable improvements.

## Key Features:

- Overall Customer Satisfaction: Track CSAT trends over time and identify areas for improvement.

- Agent Performance: Analyze call volume, handle time, resolution rates, and identify top and struggling agents.

- Calls by Time: Understand peak hours and optimize staffing needs.

- Call Trends by Topic: Analyze patterns and resolution rates for different call types.

- Interactive Filters and Drill-down: Explore data by agent, topic, date, and other dimensions for deeper analysis.

## Technologies:

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Project Structure:

1.PwC Call Centre.pbix: The primary Power BI report file containing visualizations and interactive features.
